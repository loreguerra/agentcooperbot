Packard Sawmill? 
Where's Mr. Packard? 
Who's the glad-handing dandy? 
Who's the lady with the log? 
I will remind you that these crimes occurred at night.
You know why I'm whittling? 
"Because that's what you do in a town where a yellow light still means slow down, not speed up."
"Sheriff, that reminds me. Can you recommend to me a good, inexpensive hotel or motel? Now it doesn't have to be fancy and I mean that. "
"Sold. Well, tomorrow comes early."
Can I ask her about her log? 
Give me a donut.
Gentlemen. When two separate evens occur simultaneously pertaining to the same object in inquiry we must always pay strict attention.
There's over ten thousand dollars here. That's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.
"Harry, you're all right."
I think I saw a cottontail rabbit! 
Snowshoe? 
Snowshoe. Snowshoe rabbit.
Black as midnight on a moonless night. 
Black as midnight on a moonless night. 
I still can't get the taste of fish-filtered coffee out of my mouth.
Who's the lady with the log? 
"Right. Well, I guess you can go then. "
Mm-hm. 
"Oh, fellas, one more thing. Pray for the health and safety of James Hurley, because if anything happens to him, I'm coming for you. "
"Sheriff, what are you sitting around for? We've got places to go and people to see. "
And why is that? 
Yes? 
Really. What did it see? 
"Harry, I really have to urinate."
Black as midnight on a moonless night. 
Very nice. 
"Diane, never drink coffee that has been anywhere near a fish."
"Diane, 618 AM, room 315, Great Northern Hotel here in Twin Peaks."
Body language. 
Were you friends with Laura Palmer? 
Have you got your stories straight yet? 
Black as midnight on a moonless night. 
I wasn't dreaming. 
You were right about the smiling bag. 
"But, I... "
I believe you. 
What? 
"Albert, where does this attitude of general unpleasantness come from? "
Well if you don't want two black eyes on a regular basis I would suggest you make some kind of peace with rural life. 
How long have I been out?
"Doc, when the will is invoked, the recuperative powers of the physical body are simply extraordinary. "
How long have I been out?

A woman. 
Blonde. 
She's in high school. She is sexually active. She is using drugs. She's crying out for help. 
Thank you Carl. Sorry to wake you. 
"Don't take the ring, Laura."
"What was here, Mr. Rodd? "
"Can you tell me whose trailer it was, and who stayed in it? "
Can you tell me what their names were? 
This must be where pies go when they die.
She whispered to me who killed her 
You know... I don't remember.
"Well, I'm sure he meant to do that."
Leo... is that short for Leonard? 
Did you know Laura Palmer? 
Really? How well did you know her? 
You're lying. 
Do you have a criminal record? 
"I have. Illegal U-turn... April 1986. Drunk and disorderly... November 1987. September 1988, aggravated assult. Charges dropped. "
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura Palmer? 
"Then I guess you don't get much sleep at night, Bernie."
A man that four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks. 
She saw him physically at the train car. 
Four of us have seen him in different forms. This path is a psychic link that will lead us straight to him. 
"No, no. He spoke softly, distinctly. "
"No, Albert, I gave him my ring."
"James, you're not gonna be charged with drug posession. The cocaine we found in your bike was planted. Probally by Leo Johnson. "
Laura told me. In her dream. 
How about a confession?
Did you kill Laura Palmer? 
How about Maddy Ferguson? 
I'm asking you. 
"Does Leland know what you've done, Bob? "
What kind of fur? 
"Harry, don't make any calls. I need 24 hours. "
To finish this.
"Well, that's good news, Harry. Another piece of the puzzle. It won't be long now."
Audrey. Did you dig up any new leads at the perfume counter? 
"Maybe Leo did kill Laura Palmer, but... but we still haven't figured out who shot me. "
Well I got four through the eyes and two through each nostril.
"File it under ""F"", for ""forget it"". "
"And you tell Albert that if he wants to pursue this, "
I'll fight him all the way up the chain to Washington! 
"I'll talk to you later, Gordon. "
"Actually, it's standard issue. I made a few modifications. How long has Lucy been upset with Andy? "
"In this case, it was yelling through a megaphone."
There's no logic to work around here. Let that one go. 
In the grand design women were drawn from a different set of blueprints
"Denise, I would assume you are no longer interested in girls! "
Not really...
"Denise, I would assume you're no longer interested in girls. "
Not really.
You're making a joke! 
Who shot me Albert? 
Agent Earle? But he's retired! 
What happened? 
Where's Bob now? 
What does Bob want? 
"Now, Gordon. What the hell is this about a Mexican Chihuahua? "
Nothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup

"Harry, what's on your mind? "
About what? 
Do you belive her? 
"Well, how much do you know about her? Where she's from? Who she was before she came to Twin Peaks? "
The truth Harry. Because that's my job.
"Audrey, you're a high school girl. I'm an agent of the FBI. "
"What I want and what I need are two different things, Audrey."
Roger. I know the moves I'm supposed to make. And I know the board. 
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. And I've started to focus out beyond the edge of the board. On a bigger game. 
The sound the wind makes through the vines. The sentience of animals. What we fear in the dark and what lies beyond the darkness. 
"I'm talking about seeing beyond fear, Roger. About looking at the world with love. "
These are things I cannot control.
Have any of you fellows heard of a place called the White Lodge?

"Diane, I am now upside-down."
Fellows! I've got an idea. Why don't we let Lana and the Mayor talk things over together? Alone. 
"Now Dwayne, you can always shoot later!Talk first..."
"Major, I'm going to take a moment here. I feel the call of nature. There's nothing quite like urinating out in the open air."
