# Special Agent Dale Cooper bot

Building a chat bot with the Markov Chain module from Codecademy, using Scrapy to collect the best quotes from Dale Cooper via IMDb.

Right now, the quotes are extracted according to actor URL, cleaned up, and dumped into a JSON file using a feed export.

In the future, I'd like to set up a pipeline and use JsonItemExporter to export the data to a JSON file, so everything is automated.
